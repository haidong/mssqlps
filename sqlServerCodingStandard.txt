Adapted from Red Gate Guide to SQL Server Team-based development book

1. Keep your database case-insensitive, even if your data has to be case-sensitive, unless you are developing in a language for which this is inappropriate.
2. Capitalize all the Scalars and Schema object names (e.g. Invoice, Basket, Customer, CustomerBase, Ledger).
3. Object names should be singular. There can be rare expceptions, when the plural form of is commonly used and accepted. If possible, use a collective name for tables or views, such as "flock", "team", etc.
4. Uppercase all reserved words (such as SELECT, WITH, PIVOT, FROM, WHERE), including functions and data types.
5. Put block delimiters (such as BEGIN and END) on a new line by themselves, correctly indented.
6. Always use the semicolon to aid the reading of code, even where SQL syntax states that it is only optional.
7. Use an increased indent for subordinate clauses if the ON, INTO, and HAVING statement is at the start of the line.
8. One can keep a list item on the same line as SELECT, the rest of the list items should each occupy a line, with a comma and space in front of it for easy commenting out.
